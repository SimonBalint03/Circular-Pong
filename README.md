Circular Pong is a reimagining of the classic Pong game. With a circular arena this game provides more variation. 
The game also includes a retro style visualization with subtle visual effects.
Circular Pong contains two power ups, that modify the paddles size.
## Controls
The paddle will go into the direction of the pressed button. So when commanded to go up, the paddle will move in the shortest way to the top of the circle.
